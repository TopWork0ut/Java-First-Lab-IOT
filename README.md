## Java-Lab1

### Task condition (First Lab) - as an example: 

Create a class "Artificial Christmas tree" which contains fields:
- name of the manufacturer
- height (in centimeters)
- price
- material of production

------

### To run the program you just need to:

1) Run the terminal and go into the folder which is previous to the package "iot".

2) Run javac which will convert it into class file ( from readable for eyes code to the bytecode ), that will be read by JVM.

```java
javac iot/*.java
```

3) Run Main.class which alredy includes bytecode by this command:

```java
java iot.Main
```

That's all ;)
